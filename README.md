<h2 align="center" id="Inspiration"> :label: Inspiration</h2>

Considering the importance of safety and security of women in India, I wanted to give it a try from my end to address the issue in a simpler and safer way.  The app is about safety as well as awareness & makes the user safe & confident. It is easy to use because of it's user friendly and easy to navigate UI. I wanted to give them a tap on the shoulder to keep going and not give up! 
<br>
Keeping this mind I developed an application named <b>GoSecure</b>.
